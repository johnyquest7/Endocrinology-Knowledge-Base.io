    <h1>What are the possible outcomes of thyroid nodule biopsy?</h1>
    <p>Thyroid nodule biopsy, also known as fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, is a crucial diagnostic tool for evaluating thyroid nodules. The possible outcomes of a thyroid nodule biopsy can be categorized into several groups:</p>

    <h2>Biopsy Results</h2>

    <h3>Benign</h3>
    <p>The majority of thyroid nodule biopsies (approximately 70%) yield benign results (<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/thyroid-biopsy">Cleveland Clinic</a>). This indicates that the nodule is non-cancerous and typically requires no further intervention unless it causes symptoms due to its size or growth (<a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/care/ent/surgery/thyroid/thyroid-nodules-diseases/evaluation">Mount Sinai</a>).</p>

    <h3>Malignant</h3>
    <p>About 3% to 7% of thyroid biopsy results are classified as malignant (<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/thyroid-biopsy">Cleveland Clinic</a>). This diagnosis confirms the presence of thyroid cancer and usually necessitates surgical intervention.</p>

    <h3>Suspicious</h3>
    <p>When a biopsy result is deemed suspicious, there is a 60% to 75% chance that the nodule is cancerous (<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/thyroid-biopsy">Cleveland Clinic</a>). These cases often require additional testing or surgical removal for definitive diagnosis.</p>

    <h3>Atypia of Undetermined Significance (AUS)</h3>
    <p>This category indicates that the nodule has both benign and malignant characteristics. Approximately 5% to 15% of nodules in this category are ultimately found to be cancerous (<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/thyroid-biopsy">Cleveland Clinic</a>).</p>

    <h3>Follicular Neoplasm</h3>
    <p>For nodules classified as follicular neoplasms, it is challenging to determine malignancy without surgical removal. About 15% to 30% of these nodules are eventually diagnosed as cancerous (<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/thyroid-biopsy">Cleveland Clinic</a>).</p>

    <h3>Non-diagnostic</h3>
    <p>A non-diagnostic result occurs when there are insufficient cells in the sample to make a reliable diagnosis (<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/thyroid-biopsy">Cleveland Clinic</a>). This outcome is seen in about 7.2% of cases, and of these, approximately 13.4% are found to be cancerous when surgically removed (<a href="https://www.thyroid.org/patient-thyroid-information/ct-for-patients/february-2023/vol-16-issue-2-p-7-8/">American Thyroid Association</a>).</p>

    <h2>Accuracy and Limitations</h2>
    <p>The overall accuracy of thyroid nodule biopsy is approximately 86% (<a href="https://www.thyroid.org/patient-thyroid-information/ct-for-patients/february-2023/vol-16-issue-2-p-7-8/">American Thyroid Association</a>). However, false-negative results can occur. For nodules 4 cm or larger, the accuracy of FNA biopsy decreases significantly (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2910711/">PMC</a>).</p>
